# Thesis-project-Blockchain-enabled-emission-management-system-in-the-natural-gas-supply-chain.

The objective of this research is the examination of the utilization of Blockchain technology 
in the natural gas supply chain, with a key emphasis on the efficient monitoring of emissions.  
Blockchain technology, which is the foundation of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, provides 
an integrated platform of development for applications that require transparency, efficiency, 
and traceability.  
The ambitious plan of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 highlights the necessity of 
developing precise and transparent reporting solutions. Such solutions would equip 
regulators and businesses with the essential tools to identify production bottlenecks that 
cause excessive emissions, facilitating their resolution and stimulating the refinement of 
current regulations. 
This research focuses on the design and the development of a blockchain-enabled emission 
management system in the natural gas supply chain system. This study includes: 
• An overview of the fundamental processes within the life cycle of natural gas. 
• An analysis of the basic principles of blockchain technology. 
• The creation of a simplified mapping system to trace the source of emissions within 
the natural gas supply chain, based on data obtained by EPA reports. 
• The implementation of this mapping system into a pseudo-blockchain application 
that adheres to the principles of blockchain technology. 
This thesis aims at validating the feasibility of such an application and establishing the 
foundation for future expansion. This includes the further development of the mapping 
system and the creation of an operational decentralized application capable of real-time 
data collection.
